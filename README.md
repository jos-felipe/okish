# Occami Shell

It is free software inspired by bash that aims to be a command line interpreter for interactive development environments in POSIX systems.

Occam's Razor is the philosophy that guides development and decision-making in the face of conflicts, keeping only the features most used by developers and, in the case of multiple solutions, choosing the simplest.

The initiative also serves as a laboratory to train software engineering techniquesâ€”unit tests, integration tests, teamwork, asynchronous communication, code versioning, automated test routines, etc.

This shell has the following features:

+ Display a **prompt** when waiting for a new command.

+ Have a working **history**.

+ Search and launch the right executable (based on the **PATH** variable or using a relative or an absolute path).

+ Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal. Consider the implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will not access your main data strucutures.

+ Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the subject as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).

+ Handle ' (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence.

+ Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).

+ Implement **redirections**:

	* '<' should redirect input.
	* '>' should redirect output.
	* '<<' should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn't have to update the history!
	* '>>' should redict output in append mode.

+ Implement **pipes** (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

+ Handle **environment variables** (**$** followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand their values.

+ Handle **$?** which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

+ Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in **bash**.

+ In interactive mode:

	* ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	* ctrl-D exits the shell.
	* ctrl-\ does nothing.

+ Implement the following **builtins**:
	* echo with option -n
	* cd with only a relative or absolute path
	* pwd with no options
	* export with no options
	* unset with no options
	* env with no options
	* exit with no options
